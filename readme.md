The following commands will launch the tests with the individual browsers:

    ./gradlew chromeTest
    ./gradlew firefoxTest

Or, you can run all the tests with this command:

	./gradlew test

Beyond the three specs you have asked me to create, here's a list of additional functionality that can be tested with automation:

1) Verify each registration price.  This would be done via a Spock data table.
2) Edit participant details
3) Delete participant
4) Delete user
5) Payment and payment verification
6) Check in/out registered participants
7) Scholarship request
8) Various front end standards - form validation, JS errors, Favicon, 404/503 error pages
9) Page load performance 
10) The list goes on and on!
